History:

v0.9.0: 1 December 2004, release April 2005
- Complete rewrite that follow the interface structure as described by w3c.
	In the mean time php 5.0 has been released with built-in support and a
	decent implementation of the XML DOM, so this will be the final release
	of this library. See docs/index.html for more info...

v0.8.5: 18 October 2003
- Added support for contentType property - defaults to 'text/xml'.
- Added support for nodeType property.
- Added preliminary support for cdata-section: when not embedded as textnode
	it'll parse as cdata tag.
- Added support for character encoding through the main xml-tag in xml docs.
	Supported character encodings (through PHP): ISO-8859-1, US-ASCII, UTF-8.
- Optimized appendChild-method: got rid of unnecessary loops that would build
	the nextSibling and previousSibling pointers
- createTextNode was non-compliant and it wrecked the childrens-tree. Fixed!
- Re-evaluated some pieces of code and fixed some small bugs.
- Updated license information, documentation and examples.

v0.8: 2002
- First public release after some thorough testing on production stable
	web-applications.
